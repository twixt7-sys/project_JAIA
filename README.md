## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Loop
    1. **Tutorial Phase**: Learn the core controls, combat system, and basic mechanics.
    2. **Starting Town**: Acts as the central hub. Players can buy gear, accept quests, and interact with NPCs.
    3. **Exploration Phase**: Navigate the open world map and access procedurally generated areas.
    4. **Combat & Gathering**: Engage in real-time combat, fight monsters, gather loot, and collect resources.
    5. **Return & Progress**: Go back to town to turn in quests, upgrade gear, unlock new locations, and train proficiencies.
    6. **Repeat Loop**: With every cycle, new quests, zones, abilities, and story fragments are unlocked.

This loop encourages a mix of preparation, skill mastery, and gradual world progression.

### Combat System
- **Type**: Real-time action combat
- **Resources**:
	- **Stamina**: Governs physical actions like dodging, sprinting, and melee attacks.
	- **Mana**: Used for casting magic and skills.
	- **Cooldowns**: Most abilities and magic require cooldown timers to prevent spamming.
- **Combos**: Chaining basic and advanced attacks can trigger combo finishers and elemental interactions.
- **Magic Compounding**: Players can combine compatible magic types mid-cast for enhanced or hybrid effects.
- **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies follow pattern-based AI with reactive responses to player movement and spells.

---

### Growth & Progression
- **Proficiency-Based System**:
	- Instead of traditional XP levels, players grow by **using** specific weapons, spells, and tools.
	- Frequent use increases **proficiency**, unlocking new abilities, techniques, and passive bonuses.
- **Gear Progression**:
	- Weapons, armor, and tools can be enhanced or altered using resources gathered from procedural maps.
- **Unlockable Areas**:
	- As proficiency and key quests are completed, new zones, dungeons, and secrets are unlocked.
